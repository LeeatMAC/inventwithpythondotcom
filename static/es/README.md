A glossary has been added in translations/es/ under the name of "glosario.txt" to be a reference for all translators to use the same translations.

TATETI.py
---------

Took the freedom of modifying line 147 to print the article preceding the noun 'jugador' / 'computadora' accordingly, since these nouns have different genders (and so do the articles). "Ground rules" should be set within other spanish translators to avoid translating differently because of regional variations in language. 

EVASOR.py
---------

Changed the start window and game over window texts alignment since spanish texts are larger.
