<p>TODO - Discuss rounding errors.</p>

<p>Python (along with many other programming languages) represents floating point numbers that are not always perfectly precise. This can cause small "rounding" errors to happen.</p>

<p>For example, notice this odd error:</p>

<pre>>>> 0.1 + 0.1
0.2
>>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
0.30000000000000004
>>></pre>

<p>Most of the time, these small errors don't matter. But it is something to be aware of.</p>

<p>Here's a good technical discussion about it: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html">What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic</a></p>
