<h1>Traces</h1>

<p>Under construction. The traces were all done for the 1st edition of the book, which used Python 2 instead of Python 3. I'll try to update these as soon as possible (though most likely I won't have time to get to this).</p>

<p>I highly recommend the Online Python Tutor: <a href="http://pythontutor.com/">http://pythontutor.com/</a></p>
<!--
<p>Traces that accompany the book will be created soon. Check the <a href="/blog">blog</a> for news and updates to the site.</p>

<p>For now, there are a little number of traces available:</p>

<p><a href="/traces/guess.html">Guess the Number</a> (and a <a href="/traces/guess2.html">second Guess the Number trace</a>)</p>
<p><a href="/traces/jokes.html">Jokes</a></p>
<p><a href="/traces/dragon.html">Dragon Realm</a></p>


<p>These traces are made using some open source software I wrote called <a href='http://traceytext.sourceforge.net/'>TraceyText</a>. It is available for download at <a href='http://traceytext.sourceforge.net/'>http://traceytext.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
