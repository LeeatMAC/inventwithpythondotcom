<h1>Educational Discount</h1>

<p>If you are a teacher or education, email the author at <a href="mailto:al@inventwithpython.com">al@inventwithpython.com</a> to receive over a 50% discount code for the books. This code will work for any quantity of books. The code must be used from the CreateSpace stores instead of Amazon.</p>

<h1>Donate Books for Teachers, Librarians, and Instructors</h1>

<p>If you would like to purchases books for educators or are an educator that would like free copies of the book, please email the author at <a href="mailto:al@inventwithpython.com">al@inventwithpython.com</a>. This page will be used to match up people who need books and people who can donate books, as well give recognition to people making these donations. (I got the idea for this from Cory Doctorow, who has <a href="http://craphound.com/makers/donate/">a page set up</a> to donate book copies to other people.)</p>
