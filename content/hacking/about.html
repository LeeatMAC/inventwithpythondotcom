<h1>About the Author</h1>
<p><img src='images/glasses_pushup.jpg'></p>


<p>Albert Sweigart (but you can call him Al), is a software developer in San Francisco, California who enjoys haunting coffee shops and making useful software. Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python is his third book.</p>

<p>His first two books, <a href="/chapters">Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python</a> and <a href="/pygame/chapters">Making Games with Python & Pygame</a> can be read online for free.</p>

<p>He is originally from Houston, Texas. He laughs out loud when watching park squirrels, which makes people think he’s a simpleton. He almost ended up working at the NSA after college, but then again we all do dumb things when we are young.</p>
