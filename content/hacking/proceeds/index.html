<h1>Record of Proceeds Donation</h1>

<p>While the ebook version of <em>Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python</em> is free to download, 100% of the proceeds from sales of the hard copies is donated to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">The Tor Project</a>. These groups do a wonderful job of promoting digital civil liberties and online culture.</p>

<p>Royalties for each copy of the book is $8.92 (slightly different for different sales channels and purchases in Euros and Pounds). The royalty checks from <a href="http://createspace.com">CreateSpace.com</a> for each month are transferred roughly 30 days after the end of the month (it takes another month for the payment history to update itself; I don't have the exact currency exchange rates until then). I'll be posting the amounts and dates for the public record on this page.</p>

<p>For purchasers with privacy concerns, the only data I have about who buys my books is a (rough) date of the purchase and whether it was paid in US Dollars, Pounds, or Euros. The CreateSpace page that I view my sales record on <a href="/images/createspacescreenshot.png">looks like this</a>. I make the payments as soon as I see the entry appear on the Payment History report so that I can calculate how much of my royalty (in dollars) comes from the various currencies for the Hacking Secret Cipher sales.</p>

<p>Donations made through PayPal or Bitcoin on this site are not included in the amounts donated.</p>
