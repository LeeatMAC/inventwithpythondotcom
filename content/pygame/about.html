<p>Albert Sweigart (but you can call him Al), is a software developer in San Francisco, California who enjoys bicycling, reading, volunteering, computer security, haunting coffee shops, and making useful software.</p>

<p>He is originally from Houston, Texas. He finally put his University of Texas at Austin computer science degree in a frame. He laughs out loud when watching park squirrels, and people think he's a simpleton.</p>

<p>Al has written two books, <a href="chapters">"Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python"</a> and <a href="pygame/chapters">"Making Games with Python & Pygame"</a>.</p>
